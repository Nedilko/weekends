## Motivation

Imagine that you are working hard, dreaming about future weekends.
And you ask yourself, how much time left until weekends.
The answer is this application.
It will show you realtime countdown to weekends,
and after timer finished countdown, application greets you with kind text.

## General
As user I want to have application which shows timer in the center of screen.
After timer reaches end, greetings text must replace timer.
This timer must be configurable through settings modal.
Settings modal must be able to change: greetings text, day and hour.
Application must have two color themes: light and dark.
As user to be more informative I want to see application name in the center of screen.
As user I want timer to have a label at bottom of it, explaining that timer is showing time left to weekends.
Application Ui must meet design.
